**We yearn, learn and travel a different journey every time we read a book!**

**While we know that each person is different, the thirst for knowledge, creativity , entertainment, the therapeutic and satiating feeling can be provided by a book of interest. And to each one's own**

**Through *"Amigo De Libro"* we make an effort to put you in good company of yet another friend, a good book, who may take you on to a magical journey**
