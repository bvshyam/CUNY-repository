Slicing is used to get multiple characters (a substring) from a string.
Its syntax is similar to that of indexing, but instead of just one index you use two indices (numbers)
separated by a colon, e.g. <code>str[ind1:ind2]</code>.

Use slicing to get <code>"Python"</code> from the <code>monty_python</code> variable.
