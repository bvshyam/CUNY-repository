Backslash is used to escape single or double quotation marks,
for example <code>'It\'s me'</code> or <code>"She said \"Hello\""</code>.
The special symbol <code>'\n'</code> is used to add a line break to a string.

Single quotation mark could be used in double quoted string without escaping and vice versa.
