Tuples are almost identical to lists. The only significant difference between tuples and lists is that
tuples cannot be changed:
you cannot add, change, or delete elements from the tuple.
Tuples are constructed by a comma operator enclosed in parentheses, for example <code>(a, b, c)</code>.
A single item tuple must have a trailing comma, such as <code>(d,)</code>.
