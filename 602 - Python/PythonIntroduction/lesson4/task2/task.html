You can add new items at the end of the list, by using the <code>append()</code> method and concatenation.
Unlike strings, lists are a mutable type, i.e. it is possible to change their content using
<code>lst[index] = new_item</code>

Replace <code>'dino'</code> with <code>'dinosaur'</code> in the <code>animals</code> list.
