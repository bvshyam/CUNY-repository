Variables are used to store values so we can refer to them later. A variable is like a label, and you use the '<code>=</code>' symbol,
known as the assignment operator, to assign a value to a variable. An assignment can be chained, e.g. <code>a = b = 2</code>

Change the value stored in the variable <code>greetings</code>.
