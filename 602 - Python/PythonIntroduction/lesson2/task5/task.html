Just as with any other programming language, the addition (<code>+</code>), subtraction (<code>-</code>), multiplication (<code>*</code>), and division (<code>/</code>) operators can be used with numbers.
In addition Python has the power (<code>**</code>) and modulo (<code>%</code>) operators.

Divide the value stored in the variable <code>number</code> by <code>2</code>, and then calculate the remainder.
