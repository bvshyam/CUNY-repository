```

In this project, you’re given a text file with chess tournament results where the information has some structure. Your
job is to create an R Markdown file that generates a .CSV file (that could for example be imported into a SQL database)
with the following information for all of the players:

Player’s Name, Player’s State, Total Number of Points, Player’s Pre-Rating, and Average Pre Chess Rating of Opponents
For the first player, the information would be:

Gary Hua, ON, 6.0, 1794, 1605

1605 was calculated by using the pre-tournament opponents’ ratings of 1436, 1563, 1600, 1610, 1649, 1663, 1716, and
dividing by the total number of games played.

If you have questions about the meaning of the data or the results, please post them on the discussion forum. Data
science, like chess, is a game of back and forth…

The chess rating system (invented by a Minnesota statistician named Arpad Elo) has been used in many other contexts,
including assessing relative strength of employment candidates by human resource departments.

**Import necessary Library**

```{r libary-load}
library(stringr)

```


**Load the text file data into a dataframe and combine the columns**

```{r complete-data,eval=TRUE}

chess_data <- read.table("C:/CUNY/Courses/CUNY-repository/607/Project1/Data/tournamentinfo.txt",header=FALSE,sep = "\t",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)


combined_data <- paste (chess_data[seq(5,196,3),], chess_data[seq(6,196,3),1],sep = "")

```


**Fetch the location of | and split the data into list. Convert that list to dataframe**

```{r location,eval=TRUE}

str_location <- str_locate_all(combined_data,"\\|")


# create a list and its size

datalist <- vector("list",NROW(combined_data))

#Loop through the datalist for all the rows trim the spaces

for(i in 1:NROW(combined_data)) {

for(j in 1:20) {

datalist[[i]][j] <- str_trim(substr(combined_data[i],str_location[[i]][j],str_location[[i]][j+1]),"both")

}
}

# convert list to dataframe


csvdf <- do.call(rbind.data.frame, datalist)

#Set temp names for the dataframe

csvdf <- setNames(csvdf,c(1:20))


```

**Replace all the | using regular expression with help of spply**


```{r cleandata,eval=TRUE}


#Dataframe without | and it has 

without_symbols_df <- data.frame(sapply(csvdf,function(x){
  x <- str_replace(x,"\\|\\s?", "")
  x <- str_replace(x,"\\s+?\\|", "")
  x <- str_replace(x,"\\|", "")
  x <- str_trim(x,"both")
  return(x)
}))

#Convert the full dataset dataframe to the required columns dataframe 

avg_df <- data.frame(without_symbols_df$X1,without_symbols_df$X2,str_extract(without_symbols_df$X3,"\\d+"),str_extract(without_symbols_df$X4,"\\d+"),str_extract(without_symbols_df$X5,"\\d+"),str_extract(without_symbols_df$X6,"\\d+"),str_extract(without_symbols_df$X7,"\\d+"),str_extract(without_symbols_df$X8,"\\d+"),str_extract(without_symbols_df$X9,"\\d+"),str_replace_all(trimws(substr(without_symbols_df$X11,15,19)),"P",""),0,stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

#Set correct names for all the fields

avg_df <- setNames(avg_df,c("Player","Points","Play1","Play2","Play3","Play4","Play5","Play6","Play7","Previous_points","Sum"))


#Set 0 for all the NA

avg_df[is.na(avg_df)] <- 0

```

```{r findavg,eval=TRUE}


#Replace the the oppenent number with their previous score

i <- 0
j <- 0
avg_df1 <- avg_df
for(i in 1:nrow(avg_df1)) {
  for(j in 3:9) {

avg_df1[i,j] <- avg_df1[avg_df1[i,j],10]

}
}


#Set 0 for all NA


avg_df1[is.na(avg_df1)] <- 0

#Convert Char columns to numeric


columns <- c(3:10)
avg_df1[,columns] <- apply(avg_df1[,columns],2,function(x){ as.numeric(as.character(x))})

avg_df1[is.na(avg_df1)] <- 0



#Finally find out the average

avg_df1$Sum  <- rowMeans(avg_df1[,3:9],1)

#Remove unwanted fields

remove(chess_data,csvdf,without_symbols,without_symbols_df,columns,combined_data,datalist,i,j,str_location,avg_df)


```
